## 📝 Changelog

| Date | What changed |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-09 | Initial progress snapshot created |
| 2026-05-09 | Built Calendar page (Month/Week/Day views, Add Event & Log Completion modals, mock data) |
| 2026-05-09 | Created `deploy-skill.md` with instructions for deploying the NutJob application to the local machine |
| 2026-05-17 | Built Blocks page Phase 2 — wired up Supabase persistence, created Server Actions for block creation, fixed RLS, and added optimistic UI updates |
| 2026-05-17 | Built complete Supabase schema — 13 tables: user_profiles, blocks (seeded), block_alerts, soil_water_readings, phenology_records, tissue_samples, fertigation_log, scouting_reports, pest_observations, weather_snapshots, activity_log, recommendations + upgraded calendar_events. All tables have RLS + policies. |
| 2026-05-19 | Built Recommendations page scaffolding (route, server fetch, card grid, accept/skip), then added edit modal — manager can tweak the AI title, add a personal note, and accept with changes (status → "edited"); manager note shown in history view. |
| 2026-05-19 | Wired Accept → activity_log write-back. Accept (and "Accept with changes") now inserts an activity_log row (mapped activity_type, block_id, rationale, performed_by, JSON details) and stores the returned activity_log_id on the recommendation, closing the feedback loop. |
| 2026-05-19 | Implemented AI generation — installed @anthropic-ai/sdk, added generateAIRecommendations server action that gathers per-block context (soil, weather, alerts, scouting, tissue samples), calls Claude Haiku with a cached system prompt, validates JSON output, and inserts into Supabase. Added "Generate AI Insights" button to the toolbar. |
| 2026-05-19 | Built Activity Log page — server route + ActivityLogClient with live search by title, filter by activity type and block, entry count, colour-coded type badges, and empty state. Data sourced from Supabase activity_log table (written to by accepted recommendations). |
| 2026-05-19 | Wired calendar completions → activity_log. Fixed three bugs: (1) createEvent now returns the real Supabase UUID so the optimistic local state is patched and completions use the correct ID; (2) activity_log insert uses createAdminClient to bypass RLS; (3) performed_by set to user.id (UUID) not user.email. |
| 2026-05-19 | Enhanced farm map: north compass SVG overlay (top-right of map, brand-colour N arrow), dynamic grid sizing (expands beyond 3 columns automatically), map position inputs (column, row, col span, row span) in BlockFormModal, and updateBlock now persists map position to Supabase. |
| 2026-05-19 | Lab test result logging: LogTestResultModal with block selector, date, lab ref, pH/EC/moisture/temp/deficit inputs, notes, and PDF/image file attachment. logTestResult server action uploads file to lab-reports Supabase storage bucket and inserts manual reading into soil_water_readings. SoilWaterTab shows Lab Test History section with signed-URL file link. |
| 2026-05-19 | Expanded lab test modal to full Turkish lab report standard: Soil Test (pH, EC, organic matter, P₂O₅, K₂O, lime, CEC, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, B, soil texture) and Water Test (pH, EC in µs/cm). Added live benchmark status badges per parameter. Added "Whole Farm" scope option (null block_id). Lab Test History now shows colour-coded parameter chips with benchmark indicators. Added test_type and parameters JSONB columns to soil_water_readings. |
| 2026-05-21 | Phase 4 — Replaced CSS grid farm map with Leaflet satellite map (Esri World Imagery, no API key). User draws GPS polygon boundaries for each block in edit mode; polygons persist to Supabase `boundary` JSONB column. Added GoToLocationBar for jumping to non-adjacent farm plots by entering GPS coordinates. Map is static (view-only) by default; "Edit Farm Map" enables drawing tools; "Accept Changes" persists all boundary edits; "Cancel" reverts. BlockFormModal updated: removed grid position inputs, added boundary status badge. **Requires manual SQL migration**: `ALTER TABLE blocks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS boundary JSONB;` |
| 2026-05-24 | Phase 5 — Fully implemented user roles (admin, supervisor, worker), permissions gating, team/user management dashboard inside settings (changing roles, creating users/workers), and session persistence ("Remember Me" logic) at login. ESLint clean with 0 warnings/errors. |
| 2026-05-24 | Phase 6 — Fully integrated dashboard layer with Supabase live database. Connected KPIGrid (dynamic moisture, rain totals, alert counters), ActiveAlerts (live unresolved list), BlockStatusGrid (real block health), UpcomingCalendar (live events), and ActivityFeed (completed actions log). Completed full linter and production build compilation verify with 0 warnings/errors. |
| 2026-05-24 | AI soil/water test result extraction: Replaced Turkish-only regex/positional PDF parser with an advanced multimodal Gemini 2.5 Flash processor via OpenRouter and Trigger.dev. Accepts both PDF and image (PNG, JPEG, etc.) uploads. extracts pH, EC, macronutrients, minerals, and soil texture directly into the LogTestResultModal. |
| 2026-05-24 | Robust Soil Extraction Fix — Enhanced `extract-soil-test` API route to support direct, self-contained OpenRouter LLM extraction when running locally, with a graceful Trigger.dev fallback. Resolves local Trigger.dev authentication and `ApiClientMissingError` crashes on server start. |
| 2026-05-24 | Phase 7 — Built Inventory Page: Asset and Consumable management. Added local-first data store for asset status, maintenance logs, and consumable balances, complete with low-stock alerts, searchable dropdown suggestions, calendar event usage linking, and full role-based permissions (admin/supervisor vs worker read-only). |
| 2026-05-26 | Option A — (1) Fixed recommendations ordering: pending cards now sorted by confidence DESC (highest urgency first), with created_at DESC as tiebreaker. (2) Added "Log Activity" manual quick-entry to Activity Log page: `LogActivityModal` (activity type grid, title, block, datetime, notes) with `logActivity` server action (admin client bypass of RLS), optimistic prepend to list, and role-gating (supervisor/admin only). TypeScript clean — 0 errors. |
| 2026-05-26 | Settings Page completed — Rebuilt `SettingsForms.tsx` with 6 role-gated tabs: (1) Account & Security, (2) Team Management, (3) Block Configuration (per-block field_capacity/wilting_point/notes with Supabase persistence + live progress bars), (4) Alert Thresholds (5 sliders in localStorage: soil moisture, water deficit, heat stress, rain skip, pest risk), (5) Sensor Connections (channel status + copy-to-clipboard ingest endpoint reference), (6) Weather & AI (farm lat/lng with Open-Meteo live test + Netlify AI Gateway config). TypeScript clean — 0 errors. |
| 2026-05-26 | AI engine switched to direct OpenRouter calls — Removed Trigger.dev dependency from `generateAIRecommendations`; logic now runs inline in the server action using the OpenAI SDK pointed at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` with model `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. Context gathering (blocks, soil, weather, alerts, scouting, tissue), prompt, JSON parsing, validation, and DB insert all inlined. Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var. |
| 2026-05-26 | Lint clean sweep — Fixed all 20 ESLint errors: removed unused `gemini`/`AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from recommendations actions, converted two `useEffect` setState calls to lazy state initializers in SettingsForms, escaped apostrophe entity, added file-level any-disable in inventory actions, removed unused imports (`ASSET_SUGGESTIONS`, `Filter`, `isPending`), typed `recentCalendarEvents` and `events` props properly. 0 errors, 0 warnings. |
| 2026-05-26 | Requirements updated — added three new requirements: (1) Multi-farm support (single login, farm selector, per-farm isolated data and role scoping); (2) Localisation to Arabic and Turkish with RTL layout, locale-aware formatting, and AI responses in active language; (3) Mobile-first optimisation (bottom nav, swipe gestures, service worker offline reads, background sync, lazy loading <3 s on 4G). |
| 2026-05-26 | Branding — Replaced placeholder "N" icon in Sidebar and Leaf icon in Login page with the NutJob tree+almond logo mark (cropped from brand asset, saved as `public/icon.png`). |
| 2026-05-26 | Branding refinement — Login splash screen updated to use full logo (`logo-full.png`: tree+almond mark + "NutJob almond farms" + "HARVESTED WITH CARE") with transparent background. Added radial back-light glow behind the logo on the dark green panel. Sidebar retains icon-only mark with transparent background. |
| 2026-05-29 | Lazy-loading — 9 modal components converted to `next/dynamic` (ssr: false) across InventoryPage, CalendarPage, BlocksPage, ActivityLogClient. BlockDetailPanel dynamically imported with pulse skeleton in BlocksPage. Dashboard refactored: each section (KPIGrid, ActiveAlerts, BlockStatusGrid, UpcomingCalendar, ActivityFeed) now self-fetches its own data as an async server component, wrapped in individual `<Suspense>` boundaries with pulse skeletons so the page shell renders instantly. Build clean — 0 errors. |
| 2026-05-28 | Mobile optimisation phase 4 — Per-page layout audit and fixes for 375px viewport: LogTestResultModal all multi-column grids → responsive (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`, `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4`); SoilWaterTab param-chips grid `grid-cols-4` → `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4`; BlockDetailPanel 5-tab bar reduced to `px-2 sm:px-3 text-xs sm:text-sm`; Settings 6-tab bar reduced to `px-3 sm:px-4 text-xs sm:text-sm`; all inventory modals (AddAsset, AddConsumable, LogMaintenance, LogUsage) and LogActivityModal block/date grid → `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`. Build clean — 0 errors. |
| 2026-05-28 | Mobile optimisation phase 3 — Service worker (`public/sw.js`): cache-first for `/_next/static/` and public images; network-first with offline HTML fallback for /dashboard, /blocks, /calendar; skips RSC navigation payloads to avoid breaking Next.js routing. Added `public/manifest.json` (PWA install, standalone display, brand green theme). `ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` client component registers SW on mount. Root layout exports `appleWebApp` metadata for iOS add-to-home-screen. Build clean. |
| 2026-05-28 | Mobile optimisation phase 2 — Calendar swipe gestures (left = next period, right = prev, 50 px threshold); CalendarHeader prev/next buttons enlarged to 44×44 px on mobile; TopNav converted to client component with ← page-title back button on sub-pages (logo shown on dashboard only). |
| 2026-05-28 | Mobile optimisation phase 1 — Added `BottomNav.tsx`: fixed bottom bar with Dashboard, Blocks, Calendar, Activity primary items + "More" slide-up drawer (Recommendations, Inventory, Settings, Sign Out), role-gated for workers. Sidebar hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`). TopNav updated: brand logo on mobile, collapsible search icon, bell tap target enlarged to 44×44 px. Dashboard layout adds `pb-24` on mobile for bottom nav clearance. Root layout exports `viewport` with `viewportFit: "cover"` for iOS safe areas. Build clean — 0 TS errors. |
| 2026-05-29 | Multi-farm support — Full architecture implemented. New `farms` + `farm_members` tables with RLS. All routes restructured to `/{farmId}/dashboard`, `/{farmId}/blocks`, etc. Farm picker page (`/farms`) with card grid and "New Farm" 3-step wizard (name → GPS → success). Farm switcher widget in sidebar. All dashboard widgets, blocks page, calendar, activity, and inventory queries scoped to the current farm via `farm_members` membership. Login redirects to `/farms` after auth. **Requires DB migration** — SQL in plan file. |
| 2026-05-29 | Farm tab bar UX fix — FarmTabs now always renders exactly 3 slots (filled or empty). Empty slots use a dashed "+" placeholder styled per-slot colour; clicking any empty slot opens the CreateFarmWizard. Fixes the 4-tab bug (was rendering filled farms + a separate empty slot, totalling more than 3 when at capacity). |
| 2026-05-29 | Farm rename in Settings — Added "Farm Identity" section at the top of the Weather & AI tab (admin only). Shows current farm name and address with Save button wired to the existing `updateFarm` server action. Farm name in the right-edge tab bar updates on next navigation. |
| 2026-05-29 | Farm creation flow simplified — CreateFarmWizard reduced to 2 steps (name/location → GPS). On completion it navigates directly to the new farm's dashboard, which already shows the "Welcome" onboarding cards (Add block, Log soil tests, etc.). Removed redundant success step that duplicated the same setup cards. Also removed FarmSwitcher from Sidebar (caused hydration error and showed a confusing "All Farms" link); farm switching is now handled exclusively by the right-edge tab bar. |
| 2026-05-30 | DB migration applied — `farms` and `farm_members` tables created with full RLS policies; `farm_id` FK column added to `blocks`. Multi-farm support now fully operational end-to-end. |
| 2026-05-30 | Locale-aware number formatting — created `utils/format.ts` with `formatPercent`, `formatTemp`, `formatMeasurement`, `formatNumber` helpers using `Intl.NumberFormat`. KPIGrid, WeatherStrip, BlockStatusGrid updated to render locale-aware values (Eastern Arabic numerals in `ar`, comma decimals in `tr`). |
| 2026-05-30 | Netlify AI Gateway wired — `NETLIFY_AI_GATEWAY_URL` env var now swaps the base URL in `generateAIRecommendations`; falls back to OpenRouter in dev. AI recommendations also return text in user's active language (`getLocale()` + language instruction injected into system prompt). |
| 2026-05-30 | Scheduled weather cron — `/api/cron/weather` route fetches current conditions + 7-day forecast from Open-Meteo for every farm with GPS coordinates. Stores farm-level and per-block `weather_snapshots` rows. Secured with `CRON_SECRET`. Designed for Netlify Scheduled Functions (every 3 hr) or any external cron trigger. |
| 2026-05-30 | Netlify deployment config — `netlify.toml` (build command, `.next` publish dir, `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, functions directory). `netlify/functions/cron-weather.mts` — Netlify Scheduled Function that calls `/api/cron/weather` every 3 hours via `CRON_SECRET` + `URL` env vars. |
| 2026-05-30 | AI feedback loop confirmed done — `applyStateMutation` in recommendations/actions.ts already handles: irrigate → insert soil_water_readings reset to field_capacity + resolve soil-water alerts; spray → resolve pest_observations + alerts; all categories → resolve domain alerts. PROGRESS.md updated to reflect ✅ status. |
